## Environmental problems we write about:

* As a species we face many environmental challenges...
* Recently climate change has been getting most of our attention:

## Planetary boundaries:

<figcaption>source: @steffen2015planetary </figcaption>

* We are in the midst of the world's 6th extinction crisis: @pimm1995future, @lawton1995extinction, @de2015estimating, @pimm2014biodiversity, @diaz2019global.

* 8 billion mouths to feed has created great stress on nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.

* What is needed is a measure of how well we are doing at addressing this multifaceted problem.

## Environmental Performance Index:

* Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is a data-driven summary of the state of sustainability based on 32 performance indicators across 11 issue categories.

<figcaption>source: @epi20</figcaption>

* Strong correlation between EPI scores and GDP/capita. Is it because:

    - economic prosperity makes it possible for nations to invest in policies and programs that lead to desirable outcomes  OR
    
    - economic prosperity allows rich countries to outsource the production of environmentally damaging goods. 

*  Trade data and standard EPI scores can be used to create a weighted EPI score that crudely addresses these leakages.

    - the relationship between gdp/capita and epi scores still exists using this weighted EPI score.

## How the sausage is made:

```{r, warning=FALSE,fig.height=9,fig.width=16}
yearly_indicator_diff
```


## Confounds: wealth and governance.

```{r, warning=FALSE,fig.height=9,fig.width=16}
controls_pairs
```

## What I am interested in: inequity

*  seems plausible the distribution of income might be related to EPI scores.

![Antilla](images/rich.WebP){height=600px}&emsp;vs.&emsp;![Elsewhere](images/poor.jpg){height=600px}<figcaption> Antilla &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;elsewhere in Mumbai.</figcaption>

  -   Are EPI scores correlated with the share of income the top 10% of earners?
  -   Are EPI scores correlated with the proportion of people living below the \$5.50/day poverty line?
  -   Or does inequity create a universal incentive to over-exploit? i.e. a "rat race" 

## Rat race?

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.height=9,fig.width=16}
ggplotly(rr) %>%
  animation_opts(transition = 0)
```

## Measures of inequity:

```{r, warning=FALSE,fig.height=9,fig.width=16}
inequality_pairs
```

## Standard EPI scores:


```{r}
hr <- huxreg(regressions$mod[[1]],regressions$mod[[2]],regressions$mod[[3]],regressions$mod[[4]], omit_coefs=c("(Intercept)","year2008","year2010","year2012","year2014","year2016","year2018","year2020"),
        statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared", `Adj R2` = "adj.r.squared"))
hr$names <- hr$names%>%str_replace_all("_"," ")%>%str_to_title()
hr
```

## First take on inequity and environment:

* Controlling for gdp/capita and measures of governance, the gini coefficient of income is negatively correlated with EPI.

* EPI scores negatively correlated with top 10 share and positively correlated with bottom 50 share.

* No strong relationship between EPI scores and the absolute number of people living in poverty.

* Caveat: EPI scores do not account for leakages between countries.  Next up: weighted EPI

## Using trade data to adjust EPIs

*  Rich countries might specialize in the production of enviro-friendly products and trade with poor countries.

* Create a weighted average of a country's EPI score and an import EPI.

* Consider Canada:

```{r}
kbl(canada)%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped",
"hover"),full_width = F)
```

Weight on import EPI is $w_{i}=\frac{M}{GDP-X+M}=$ 
`r round(canada[3,2]/(canada[1,2]-canada[2,2]+canada[3,2]),2)%>%pull()`

## Canada's import EPI:

```{r}
 kbl(canada_partners)%>%
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),full_width = F)
```

* Import EPI is a weighted average of top 5 trading partner's EPI's.

* To calculate the weights we pretend each country *only* trades with these top five trade partners.

* In an ideal world the *entire* environmental impact of producing, consuming and disposing a good or service would be attributed to the country of the consumer... a daunting challenge given the complexity of global supply chains and their numerous environmental impacts. 

## Environmental accounting

* A non-exhaustive list of problems with my "back of the envelope" adjustment. 

    - Not all imports are for consumption, they might be re-exported e.g. Singapore.
    - Weights based on dollar values do attribute environmental impacts properly.  
    - your problem...

Some other attempts at environmental accounting

  -   cover a very limited set of countries/industries/pollutants: @muradian2002embodied
  
  -   focus exclusively on $CO_2$: @peters2011growth
  

## Rich countries look a little worse, poor countries look a little better.

```

## Import weighted EPI scores


```{r}
hr <- huxreg(regressions$mod[[5]],regressions$mod[[6]],regressions$mod[[7]],regressions$mod[[8]], omit_coefs=c("(Intercept)","year2008","year2010","year2012","year2014","year2016","year2018","year2020"),
        statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared", `Adj R2` = "adj.r.squared"))
hr$names <- hr$names%>%str_replace_all("_"," ")%>%str_to_title()
hr
```



## Added variable plots:

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,results = 'hide',fig.height=9,fig.width=16}
make_av_plots <- function(mdl,var){
  var=str_sub(var,start=2)
  avPlots(mdl, var,pch=".",main="")
}

par(mfrow=c(2,4))
regressions %>%
  mutate(plots=walk2(mod,inequality,make_av_plots))
#dev.off()
```

## Second look at inequity

*  Results qualitatively similar to results using EPI.
*  I (hopefully) have been careful not to make causal claims based on this observational data...
*  i.e. I do not believe that inequality is as good as randomly assigned (conditional on the control variables).
*  What to do?

## Not much variation in inequality over time.

*  Retreat to the lab: redistribution of income in a common pool resource game similar to @budescu1992simultaneous.

## What the subjects saw: (page 1)

*   Consider a lake where <span class="math inline">\(n \approx 3\)</span> people can catch fish.
*   In this experiment you will play 20 independent rounds of the same one shot game.
*   Each round you are put into a new group of <span class="math inline">\(\approx 3\)</span> people.  
*   In each round your task is to choose how effort to put into fishing <span class="math inline">\(e_i\)</span>.
*   <em>If</em> the stock of fish <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> exceeds the total effort $f>e_1+e_2+e_3$ then every unit of effort results in one fish caught.
*   However, the stock of fish is unknown: <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> equally likely to be any real number between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(20n\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(fâˆ¼U[0,20n]\)</span>
*   If the stock of fish is lower than the total effort <span class="math inline">\(f \leq e_1+e_2+e_3\)</span> the resource is destroyed: all players catch zero fish.
*   The tradeoff: more effort more fish (if there are enough fish) vs. more effort lower probability there are enough fish.
*   For example, suppose that the sum of all the individual effort choices is <span class="math inline">\(e_1+e_2+e_3=45\)</span>: what is the probability there is enough fish?

<img width="30%" src="images/fish.png">

*   If the total effort is 45, the probability there is enough fish is .25.  


*   The expected profit function for player 1 is:  

<p>$E[\pi_1]=\left[\alpha e_1+\frac{1-\alpha}{3}(e_1+e_2+e_3)\right]\left(\frac{60-e_1-e_2-e_3}{60}\right)-\frac{e_1}{3}$</p>

*   Inside the first [square] brackets is the amount of fish you receive if there are enough fish.  
*   Inside the second (round) brackets is the probability there are enough fish.  
*   The last term is the cost of effort.  


<h3>The treatments:</h3>

*   There are going to be 3 treatments that vary by the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.  
*    You will be told the value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> for your treatment once you start the experiment.  

## Summary of last round: (Round 2):

<h2> Fish: 12.615173826925</h2><h2> Total effort: 16</h2>Because the total effort is larger than the stock of fish the resource is destroyed.<table class='t1' ><tr><th>effort</th><th>Profit</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-0.67</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>-1.67</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>-3</td></tr></table>

<h2>In your treatment $\alpha=.5$</h2>
<p>So in your treatment the expected profit function for player 1 is:</p>

<p>$E[\pi_1]= \left(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}(e_1+e_2+e_3)\right) \left(\frac{60-e_1-e_2-e_3}{60}\right)-\frac{e_1}{3}$


How much effort do you want to put into fishing in round 3? <input type="number" name="choice" step="1" placeholder="effort" min="0" max="30" />

## The treatments:

* Communism ($\alpha=0$): Prediction: free riding. 
* Universal Basic Income ($\alpha=\frac12$): Prediction: joint payoff maximizing effort.
* laissez-faire ($\alpha=1$) Prediction: tragedy of the commons.
